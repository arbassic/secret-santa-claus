# Secret Santa Claus

Angular + Express + MongoDB CRUD-like project to handle & improve holiday gifting-time process

Angular client
Server app utilizing MongoDB

## Idea

Instead of high-cost/low-effective Christmas gifting model (each member of a family gives a bunch of random gifts to everyone), the app implements a kind of a gift lottery, in which each person becomes a Santa Claus and takes care of a wishlist of a single member.

The user (one of the Christmas members) creates "event", adds himself and all other "members", distributes login URLs to companions. Then each member create his own list of gifts (a wishlist) plus a letter to the Santa Claus (this is a Christmas tradition in Poland to write one to receive presents), then when everything is complete (or almost complete) the main user triggers system to execute a lottery. Each member draws another member and secretely meets the requirements of the drawn person.

In the effect gifting cost becomes lower and everybody is satisfied and still surprised :)
